## Sichuan Mahjong Game - Python

To run the program you just have to run it from the main loop

Sichuan Mahjong Is the most popular came in China I want to challenge myself building this game using the python skills I have just learned, in Mahjong game it is having a very complex system such as the winning conditions and the conditions to perform actions and they have to manage all sorts of information like the information of players hand for four players and the deck and what cards that player have already played out.


I very much enjoy building this game during the process this game was much harder than what I thought to develop I was stuck during the hu method I do not know how to achieve this condition but I have overcome did bye thinking over and over and list all the tools and methods and technologies that I could use I was also shocked the amount of code I have to write it is very hard for me to manage these codes.


Another challenge I have experienced as Dad to plan the project out I redraw and give up on quite a few skeletons that have developed I think sanding to call the program it's also a challenging process and good planning to make your programming process much easier I have learned so much from this final project and I really liked it thank you
