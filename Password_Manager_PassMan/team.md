## Security Leader
Hello! I'm Kayla Bayusik and I'm working my way through an MS in Computer Science (I couldn't pick a concentration so I'm trying for a little of everything). Funny enough, I haven't actually finished my BS in Information Technology at RPI yet but I'm very close and then I'll wrap up the last two classes of my master's here at BU. I am really familiar with writing applications for group projects at RPI - mostly web apps but one mobile and a couple desktop apps too - so I look forward to coding in these six weeks with you guys. But I think the big thing I bring to the group, especially as the security leader, is that I am an SSCP (systems security certified practitioner) as of this March and information security is my main interest in the whole IT / CS field.
